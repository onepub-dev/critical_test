# 4.0.0
Major works to improve the performance of the --runfailed flag.
Pre 4.x --runfailed will re-run all tests contained in a Dart Library if even one of the tests failed.
With this release we only run the tests that failed.

The cli arguments have also changed to bring them closer to alignment with the 'dart test' command.

You can now pass a directory or script as a final argument and only tests in that directory/dart will
be ran.

```bash
critical_test [switches] [file or directory]
```
We have removed the --single switch use --plain-name instead.

We have introduced a --plain-name argument which allows you to run a single test via name.
If the test is nested with in a group(s) then you need to provide each of the group names
separated by a space.

```
critical_tests --plain-name="[<group name> <group name> ...] <test name>"
```
- hook switch abbreviation has changed from 'n' to 'o'


# 3.0.13
- had accidentially ignore analysis_options.yaml

# 3.0.11
 - Fixed a bug where the --runFailed switch was not finding any failed tests due to an inverted if statement.

# 3.0.10
Fixed the --no-hooks command line flag as it was being ignored.

# 3.0.9
Added:
 - Added code to run pub get on the package and any sub packages to ensure that the unit test run successfully from a code project. 
 - Use --no-warmup to suppress the pub get operations.
 - Added a hidden --track switch so we can use it in our own unit tests with --single so we can confirm the trackers behaviour. Fixed a unit test that was failing because single tests don't normally track.

Fixes:
 - We now corretly track failed test that occur during a rerun. Previously we would loose track of these failures.
 - re-wrote the failed tracker to try to handle aborts. Previously the list of failed tests would be lost if user used ctrl-c during a test run. We now try to preserve the failed test list.
